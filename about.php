                                    <p>A common saying is that "a good physician treats the disease. The great physician treats the patient who has the disease. We proudly claim that we have the most ingenious, skillful, and qualified doctors of the latter type. HMC, KTH, and LRH are homes for professional doctors who feel the pain of their patients, aim at their counseling, and strive for their best treatment. This is what the patients and their families demand. These doctors provide a working skeleton for the body of HMC,KTH, & LRH and, without their efforts, enthusiasm, and dutyfulness, it would have been impossible to gain the position where HMC, KTH & LRH now stand.</p>
